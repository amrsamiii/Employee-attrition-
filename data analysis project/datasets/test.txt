A lot has happened to us all since 1987. That’s the year The Art of the Deal
was published and became the bestselling business book of the decade,
with over three million copies in print.
(Business Rule #1: If you don’t tell people about your success, they
probably won’t know about it.)
A few months ago, I picked up The Art of the Deal, skimmed a bit, and
then read the first and last paragraphs. I realized that after seventeen years
they still rang true. I could have written these words yesterday:
First paragraph: I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more
than I’ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint
beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably
big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.
Last paragraph: Don’t get me wrong. I also plan to keep making deals, big
deals, and right around the clock.
It’s now 2004, I’m still making deals around the clock, and I still don’t
do it for the money.
I don’t think you should do it for the money, either. Money is not an
end in itself, but it’s sometimes the most effective way to help us realize
our dreams. So if you’ve got big dreams and you’re looking for a way to
make them happen, this book is for you.
